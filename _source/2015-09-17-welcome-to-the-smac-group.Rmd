With this first post we are proud to inaugurate this blog! The first step we take in this new adventure is to publish the presentations with which we officially give life to our new statistical software package “gmwm” within the R computational environment. These presentations were delivered within the framework of the ION GNSS+ 2015 conference where the features of this package are particularly relevant for inertial sensor calibration purposes. Being delivered within an engineering context, the contents of these presentations extend to the general time series model estimation field and we hope you find them interesting and/or useful for your research!

Downloads of the presentation slides are available below:
