# Intro
The GMWM is a very general method for the estimation of many time series models and is particularly 
advantageous for the estimation of latent time series or State-Space Models (SSM). Stebler et al.
(2011) showed that for these models the traditional Maximum Likelihood (ML) and other related
estimators often lead to unreliable results even in moderately complex settings. On the other hand,
GMWM-based estimators can easily overcome these difficulties and can also surprisingly outperform
