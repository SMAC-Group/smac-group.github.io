# Intro

The GMWM is a very general method for the estimation of many time series models and is particularly advantageous for the estimation of latent time series or State-Space Models (SSM). Stebler et al. (2011) showed that for these models the traditional Maximum Likelihood (ML) and other related estimators often lead to unreliable results even in moderately complex settings. On the other hand, GMWM-based estimators can easily overcome these difficulties and can also surprisingly outperform the ML for more traditional models such as ARMA models (see e.g. Guerrier et al., 2015c). Using a quantity called Wavelet Variance (WV), the idea behind the GMWM can be extended to a wide range of dependent data settings going from the modeling of latent time series and SSM to non-stationary
and spatio-temporal models.
